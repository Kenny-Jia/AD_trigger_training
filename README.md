## Introduction
This repo is primaily used for training, evals, and synthesis pipeline for work on an AD trigger.

If one is interested in making their own ntuples, please refer to https://github.com/max-cohen54/ntuple-dumper/tree/main.

This repo is split primarily into two separate developments: L1AD and HLTAD, which work respectively on the two different versions. Additional information on each can be found within those directories.
